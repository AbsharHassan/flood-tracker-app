<!-- Flood Tracker is a full-stack application designed to monitor and analyze flood data in real-time. Utilizing the power of the MERN stack, along with the Google Earth Engine API, this application processes satellite images to extract vital statistics about flood-affected areas. It offers insights into the impact on urban areas, farmlands, and road networks -->

## Basic Overview

Flood Tracker was born out of a pressing need to address the escalating challenges posed by climate change, particularly in the realm of natural disasters such as floods. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, it is essential to have robust and reliable solutions for tracking and understanding flood situations. This application aims to meet that demand by leveraging cutting-edge technology to provide accurate, timely data that can aid in effective disaster management and mitigation efforts.

The application operates by integrating the Earth Engine API to fetch satellite data, which is then processed using a custom flood detection algorithm. It also employs machine learning to classify land covers, helping to estimate the impact of floods on different land types, such as agricultural areas, urban regions, and roadways. The frontend, developed using React, presents this data in an interactive, user-friendly dashboard, making it an invaluable tool for disaster management and response teams.
